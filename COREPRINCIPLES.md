# Core Principles
> Modern day Linux distributions and desktop platforms are so close to competing against macOS and Windows in the mass market. Let's bring Linux to the average user.

## Thesis
### Introduction
ceramicOS is, as the tagline goes, "Linux for the layperson." People are often wary of switching to Linux, assuming that its all terminal-based and intended for "super tech-savvy" people, so to speak. If you've ever used a modern Linux distribution then you'll know that this simply isn't true, at least not *entirely* true. Projects like GNOME and KDE are complete desktop platforms with wonderful built-in apps to handle all of your computing essentials. So, what's the catch? Well, unfortunately, some actions still require using the terminal or complicated utilities to complete. Most people don't know what a partition or a kernel is and will likely struggle to install even the simplest of distributions, for example. Also, due to the modular, open, highly customizeable nature of Linux there are far more places for things to go wrong. Linux also has several package formats, such as `AppImage`s, `DEB`s, `RPM`s, `snap` packages, `flatpak`s, but the worst of all (user experience wise) is the plain ol' `tar` file that needs to be copied/installed by hand. Yikes. Clearly, Linux just isn't ready for mass market primetime yet, so what's the solution?

### The solution
Enter ceramicOS, the answer (well its *an* answer at least) to the increasingly prominent question; "should I switch to Linux?"
