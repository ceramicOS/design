NOTES:
- os should feature a help app with comprehensive, guided, and interactive tours of various functions
  - it must be simple
  - the tutorials must be minimal, easy to digest, and not overwhelming
  - maybe include an optional "welcome to Linux!" video after initial setup is complete to walk newbies through what's different and new in Linux compared to their previous OS
